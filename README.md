They look Bad but It's still in development

# How to Install

1. Download a HUD mod.

2. Extract the contents if needed (ZIP/RAR).

3. Navigate to your game directory, usually located at:

CSSO VERSION
/storage/emulated/0/srceng/csso/custom

CSMOS VERSION
/storage/emulated/0/srceng/csmos/custom

4. Open or create a folder named custom inside the cstrike folder.

5. Copy and paste the HUD folder into the custom directory.

6. Launch the game. The custom HUD should now be active.


# Purpose

The goal of this project is to make HUD modding simple and accessible for mobile users. It helps players change the in-game interface using only their Android device. (It's not easy for me) 

# Disclaimer

This is a fan-made project, not affiliated with Valve.

Always back up your files before applying mods.

Some mods may not work with every version or device.
